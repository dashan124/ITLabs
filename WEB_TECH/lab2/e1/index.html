    <h1>With human space flight, India to push frontiers</h1>
    <img class="headline-image" src="img/headline.jpg">

    <p>Gaganyaan, the human space flight Programme green-flagged and set for 2022 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is highly
        doable, Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation K. Sivan said here soon after it was announced on Wednesday.</p>

    <p>V.R. Lalithambika, a specialist in advanced launcher technologies, will helm the project as Director of the Human Space
        Flight Project. The mission is estimated at ₹9000 crore. Most of the critical technologies and hardware required
        for the project are ready or have been demonstrated by its centres. ISRO would now stitch them up into a complete
        project and present a comprehensive project report to get a formal approval of the government, Dr. Sivan said. “We
        have tested the necessary critical technologies required for the Human Space Flight Programme (HSP) and are confident
        of achieving it as stated by the Prime Minister,” he said.</p>

    <p>“We will now speed up the paper work and submit a project report for formal approval. We may immediately need around
        ₹ 2,000 crore for enhancing infrastructure and technologies at two or three centres and we will be asking for this
        amount,” he told The Hindu.</p>

        <p>Describing it more as a national mission than ISRO’s alone, Dr. Sivan, who is Secretary, Department of Space, said
            it would be the pride of India. It would raise scientific and technological temper across the country and inspire
            youngsters. “We are excited by this announcement. It is a gift to the nation and we feel proud. It actually energises
            us across our centres. We do not feel intimidated or tense. We have seen many challenges in our work,” Dr. Sivan
            said.</p>
